title: Configure Automatic Deployments

import useBaseUrl from "@docusaurus/useBaseUrl";

Each deployed environment comes with a preconfigured CI/CD implemented with AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild,
and AWS CodePipeline. The general idea of the deployment is for the user to push the code to a `master` branch of the
CodeCommit repository created by the Ci CDK Stack.

## Automatically synchronize external repository

### Get authenticated repository URL

AWS Boilerplate generates a user for you that has minimal permissions required for pushing code to the CodeCommit
repository. In order to implement a synchronization logic we need to get a repository URL and credentials of the user.
You can create both using a following command:

:::caution

This command will output a value with a password in a plain text!
You can pipe it to `xclip` in Linux or to `pbcopy` in Mac OS to save it directly to your clipboard.

:::

```sh
make aws-vault
make create-repo-auth-url
```

### Get authentication credentials for ECR repository

All CI pipeline builds are running within a docker image; some services, such as web app, utilise a base image that
contain preinstalled packages to speed up the whole process. Such base images automatically update on every
push to a `master` branch, so they are up to date with your code, and you don't have to really do anything besides
providing access to pull them!

1. Open `IAM` service in web console.

2. Find the `external-ci` user.

3. Navigate to `Security Credentials` tab.

4. Press `Create access key`.

5. Copy the key id and secret.

### Configure Github

1. Open `Settings` page of your repository.

2. Go to `Secrets` subpage.

3. Create following secrets:

   - `CODE_COMMIT_REPO` – [authenticated repository URL](#get-authenticated-repository-url)

   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` – [external-ci](#get-authentication-credentials-for-ecr-repository) user access key id

   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` – [external-ci](#get-authentication-credentials-for-ecr-repository) user access key secret

   - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` – set to a region to which your system is deployed

4. Test by pushing some code to your Github repository. After couple of seconds the code should be synchronized in CodeCommit.

### Configure Bitbucket

1. Open `Repository Settings` page of your repository.

2. Go to `Pipeline / Settings` sub-page.

3. Enable Bitbucket Pipelines.

4. Go to `Pipeline / Repository variables` sub-page.

5. Create following variables:

   - `CODE_COMMIT_REPO` – set value to
     [authenticated repository URL](#get-authenticated-repository-url)

   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` – `external-ci` user access key id

   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` – `external-ci` user access key secret

   - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` – set to a region to which your system is deployed

6. Test by pushing some code to your BitBucket repository. After couple of seconds the code should be synchronized in CodeCommit.

## Trigger deployment automatically

If you want a branch to be deployed automatically for every pushed commit the only thing you need to do is to name this branch
in your environment configuration file using `deployBranches` property. Check out the
[environment docs](/setup-aws/environment-stage) for more details.

## Trigger deployment manually

You can also trigger a deployment manually using AWS Console!

1. Navigate to `CodeBuild` service.

2. Find the entrypoint project named `<PROJECT_NAME>-<ENV_STAGE_NAME>` (e.g. `mypro-qa`) and navigate to it by pressing
   its name.

3. Press the "Start build with overrides" button.

4. Select the source branch and optionally a commit ID.

5. Submit by pressing "Start build" button.

6. The Pipeline should start in a few seconds.
