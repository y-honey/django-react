title: Configure CI/CD Slack Notifications

Unfortunately the notifications need to be configured using
AWS web panel.

## Create a new AWS Chatbot Client

The very first thing we need to do is to create an AWS Chatbot
client that is going to be connected to your Slack organisation
as an app.

1. Open the "AWS Chatbot" service
1. Press "Configure new client" button

1. Select "Slack"

  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/guides/cicd-slack-notifications/aws-chatbot-select-slack.png")} alt="Select Slack" />

1. Follow through the OAuth process

1. You should be able to see your client with a Workspace ID
  matching your organisation.

## Create a new channel

Next we need to select a channel to which the AWS Chatbot will
post the messages from our CI/CD.

1. Press the "Create new channel" button

  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/guides/cicd-slack-notifications/aws-chatbot-create-channel.png")} alt="Create new channel" />

1. Fill out the fields:

  - Name – whatever value, we typically call it `{project-name}-ci`
  - Channel type:
    * Public – select channel from the list

    * Private – paste the ID from the channel URL ( you can copy it from Slack)
  - Permissions – Create a new IAM role using a template
    * Channel guardrail policies – Choose `AWSDenyAll`.
  - SNS Topic – leave empty. It'll be created for us.

## Connect the AWS Chatbot to CodePipeline

The last thing to do is to connect the created AWS Chatbot channel
and our pipeline in CodePipeline.

:::note

You need to follow this step for every environment of your app.

:::

1. Fill out the name and choose a detail type

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/guides/cicd-slack-notifications/notify-settings.png")} alt="Settings" />

2. Select the triggers that should lead to a notification.
On the screenshot you can see the triggers that work well for us.

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/guides/cicd-slack-notifications/notify-triggers.png")} alt="Triggers" />

3. Choose the target type as "AWS Chatbot" and the target should
be the channel you created in the previous step.

<img src={useBaseUrl("img/guides/cicd-slack-notifications/notify-target.png")} alt="Target" />

That's it! You should be able to receive Slack notifications during
next run of your pipeline.
