## Services included in boilerplate

The boilerplate contains a number of typical services that are ready to be deployed to AWS.
Each of them resides in the `services` directory and has to contain a `Makefile`. Do not change the names of the rules
that are defined in Makefiles unless you know what you're doing. Most of them are used in CodeBuild jobs in your CI
pipeline.

- React web application
- Django backend and admin panel
- Serverless async workers
