## Services included in <ProjectName/>

<ProjectName/> comes with a set of pre-configured services that are ready to be deployed on
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) cloud infrastructure.

The project follows a monorepo repository layout and utilizes the [NX](https://nx.dev/) build system. A CLI is
also included with predefined commands, which should not be changed unless you know what you are doing. Most of these
commands are used in CodeBuild jobs in the CI pipeline.

All services are located in the `packages` directory at the root of the repository. Standard installation of the
<ProjectName/> contains following services:

- React web application
- Django backend and admin panel
- Serverless asynchronous workers
