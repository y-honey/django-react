In the fast-paced world of software development, time is of the essence. For product and development teams striving to
bring their SaaS applications to market efficiently, the challenges can be numerous and daunting. Without the aid of a
powerful tool like SaaS Boilerplate, teams may find themselves grappling with a host of issues that hamper their
progress and hinder their ability to deliver high-quality products on time.

Below you can find some common problems that product and development teams can face when embarking on SaaS application
development without the benefits of SaaS Boilerplate:

#### Increased development time

Developing a SaaS application from scratch without a boilerplate codebase can be time-consuming. Teams would need to
write code for common functionality, such as payments, subscriptions, and CRUD operations, which could significantly
slow down the development process.

#### Lack of reusability

Without a boilerplate, teams would need to reinvent the wheel for each SaaS application they build. They would have to
write custom code for common components, resulting in a lack of reusability and increased development effort for
subsequent projects.

#### Infrastructure setup complexity

Setting up the infrastructure for a SaaS application can be a complex task. Without a ready-to-use infrastructure
provided by the boilerplate, teams would need to spend time configuring and deploying infrastructure components
manually, leading to potential errors or misconfigurations.

#### Absence of continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD)

CI/CD is a crucial aspect of modern software development. Without a boilerplate that includes CI/CD capabilities, teams
would need to set up these processes from scratch, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.

#### Limited scalability

Scaling a SaaS application to handle increasing user loads can be challenging without a boilerplate that offers auto
scaling features. Teams would need to design and implement their own scaling mechanisms, which may not be as efficient
or reliable.

#### Reduced focus on core business

Without the time-saving benefits of a boilerplate, development teams would need to spend more time on non-core
functionality, such as infrastructure setup and generic feature implementation. This can detract from their ability to
focus on the unique value proposition and core business features of the application.


### What is SaaS Boilerplate?

<SBDescriptionPartial />

### Why use SaaS Boilerplate?

- Application is business agnostic - business logic is abstracted away which empowers engineers to extend them or to
remove them completely without breaking the application.

- Enables the team to rapidly build and ship new bespoke features or to extend already existing ones.

- Contains ready to use infrastructure components that are common in most of the web applications.

- Itâ€™s safe and can handle standard medium size application load using auto-scaling feature
