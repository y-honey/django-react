SaaS Boilerplate comes packed with assets management functionality that allows developers to create file uploads and
deliver assets to end-users through a CDN easily. This functionality also includes ready-to-use logic for creating image
thumbnails, making it easy to manage and display images on your website.

### Documents Page

As an example functionality of the assets management, SaaS Boilerplate contains a `Documents` page that allows users to
drop a file to be uploaded into S3 storage. The uploaded file is then listed and users can remove it from the system if
needed.

<p align="center">
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/features/assets/upload-form.png")} alt="Upload file form" />
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/features/assets/file.png")} alt="Uploaded file" />
</p>

### User Profile Avatar

The assets management functionality is also used in the user profile to upload a user avatar. Users can upload an image,
which is then stored in the S3 bucket and delivered to end-users through the CDN. The avatar image can be displayed
throughout the application, providing users with a personalized experience.

### Thumbnails

SaaS Boilerplate includes ready-to-use logic for creating image thumbnails, making it easy to display images of
different sizes on your website.
