title: Infrastructure as a Code
description: Built on top of AWS CDK
---

As the number of cloud-based applications increases, itâ€™s becoming more and more important to manage infrastructure in a
reliable and consistent way. Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a methodology that allows developers to automate the
provisioning and deployment of cloud-based infrastructure using software development techniques. The SaaS Boilerplate
uses IaC and the AWS Cloud Development Kit ([CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/index.html)) to make infrastructure
management simple and straightforward.

### Benefits of IaC and CDK

There are several benefits to using IaC and CDK in projects. First and foremost, IaC allows you to automate the
provisioning and deployment of infrastructure, which reduces the time and effort required to maintain your
infrastructure. This automation also makes it easier to replicate your infrastructure across multiple environments,
such as development, staging, and production. With IaC, developers can deploy infrastructure in a consistent and
repeatable way, which reduces the risk of errors and improves the reliability of the applications.

[CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/index.html) is a popular library for building infrastructure as code in AWS. It
allows to define the infrastructure using familiar programming languages like TypeScript, which makes it easier for
developers to manage infrastructure as part of their codebase. CDK also provides a high-level object-oriented
abstraction over AWS CloudFormation, which simplifies the creation of complex infrastructure components.

### Infrastructure as Code in the SaaS Boilerplate

The SaaS Boilerplate includes Amazon Web Services infrastructure that contains Continuous Integration and
Continuous Deployment. [All infrastructure](/introduction/architecture#system-architecture-diagram) (excluding 3rd
party services) is kept in the TypeScript code that uses CDK library. The SaaS Boilerplate contains ready-to-use
infrastructure components that are common in most web applications, such as async workers, CDN, database, load balancer
with autoscaling.


The process of setting up the working application and development infrastructure is automated, which makes it easy to
spin up multiple environments of the application by the team based on project needs. The SaaS Boilerplate provides a
consistent and repeatable way to deploy infrastructure, which reduces the risk of errors and improves the reliability
of your applications.
