title: Pre-configured CI/CD
---

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) is a methodology that allows developers to automate the process
of building, testing, and deploying their applications. CI/CD helps to reduce the time and effort required to release
new features and bug fixes, while also improving the quality and reliability of the application. The SaaS Boilerplate
includes a pre-configured CI/CD pipeline that uses AWS services like AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodePipeline
to automate the deployment process.

### Benefits of CI/CD

There are several benefits to using CI/CD in your projects. First and foremost, it allows you to automate the process of
building, testing, and deploying your application. This automation reduces the time and effort required to deploy new
features and bug fixes, which allows you to release updates more frequently. CI/CD also helps to improve the quality
and reliability of your application by automating the testing process and reducing the risk of errors.

### Pre-configured CI/CD in the SaaS Boilerplate

The SaaS Boilerplate includes a pre-configured CI/CD pipeline that is included in the infrastructure as code out of the
box. The pipeline uses AWS services like AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodePipeline to automate the deployment
process for each environment. The deployment pipeline is configured to start automatically after each code push to a
specific set of branches to the CodeCommit repository created by the CI/CD CDK stack. Each environment can have a
different branch configuration, which allows for greater flexibility in managing the deployment process.

The AWS pipeline can be triggered by Bitbucket Pipeline or Github action, which allows you to use your preferred
development workflow.

The SaaS Boilerplate provides a consistent and repeatable way to deploy your application, which
reduces the risk of errors and improves the reliability of your application. The pre-configured CI/CD pipeline is easy
to set up and can be customized to meet the specific needs of your project.
