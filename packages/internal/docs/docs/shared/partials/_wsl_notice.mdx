:::caution

If you are using a Windows machine, it's mandatory to have **WSL 2** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) installed on your system to run the commands for installing dependencies and running the application.

Please follow the [official guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) for installing WSL 2 on Windows before proceeding. Failure to do so may result in issues during the installation process.
