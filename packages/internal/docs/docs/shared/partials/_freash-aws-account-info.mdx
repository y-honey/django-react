### For Users with newly created AWS accounts
Freshly created AWS accounts come with initial limits that may be automatically increased over time based on account
activity. These limits may disrupt some procedures outlined in this guide. You have the option to request limit
increases from AWS support on your own, or explore alternative methods to experiment with <ProjectName/>. Below are the
current known limitations:

- **AWS SES is in Sandbox Mode by Default:** AWS Simple Email Service (SES) operates in
[sandbox mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/dg/request-production-access.html) initially, allowing you to send
emails only to verified email addresses and domains. Ensure you verify your test email addresses or exit sandbox mode
before attempting to use the application.
- **CodeBuild Limits to 1 Concurrent Build:** By default, the CodeBuild service is restricted to a single concurrent
build. This limitation can affect the execution of CI/CD pipelines designed to minimize build times by running multiple
CodeBuild projects simultaneously during the deployment of new application versions. As a workaround, consider manually
deploying your application following the steps in [Step 6. Deploy the app](./run-deployment-commands) until the
account's limits are increased.
- **Creating AWS CloudFront Distribution in not verified account**: Your AWS account need to be verified in order to
be able to create CloudFront Distribution that will be used for example to serve web application assets.
