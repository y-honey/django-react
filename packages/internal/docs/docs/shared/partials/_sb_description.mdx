SaaS Boilerplate is a fully functional codebase that allows you to radically decrease the time your team spends on
developing a SaaS application. Your development can re-use common components and focus on the core of your business.

It consists following architecture modules:
- Infrastructure using [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) that contains Continuous Integration
and Continuous Deployment
- Application code that contains generic functionality like:
    - [Payments and Subscriptions](/introduction/features/payments.mdx)
    - [Integration with Contentful CMS](/introduction/features/cms.mdx) as an example to be ready to build up upon
    - [Authorization](/introduction/features/auth.mdx) is ready to implement custom design or adjustments
    - [CRUD](/introduction/features/crud.mdx) as a shortcut to speed up the development
    - [*and so much more!*](/introduction/features)
