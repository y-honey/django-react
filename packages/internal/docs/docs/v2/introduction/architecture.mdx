## Services included in SaaS Boilerplate

SaaS Boilerplate comes with a set of pre-configured services that are ready to be deployed on
[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) cloud infrastructure.

The project follows a monorepo repository layout and utilizes the [NX](https://nx.dev/) build system. A `Makefile` is
also included with predefined rules, which should not be changed unless you know what you are doing. Most of these rules
are used in CodeBuild jobs in the CI pipeline.

All services are located in the `packages` directory at the root of the repository. Standard installation of the
SaaS Boilerplate contains following services:

- React web application
- Django backend and admin panel
- Serverless asynchronous workers
