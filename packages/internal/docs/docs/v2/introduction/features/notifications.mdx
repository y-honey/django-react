SaaS Boilerplate comes packed with in-app notifications functionality that allows you to keep your users informed of
important updates and actions within your application. The system is designed to be user-friendly and customizable,
making it easy for developers to add new types of notifications to the system.

### Notification Icon

Logged in users can see the notification icon in the top right corner of the application page. By clicking on the icon,
users can see the list of system notifications. The icon has an indicator of unread notifications, providing users with
a visual cue to check their notifications.

  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/features/notifications/notification.png")} alt="Notifications icon" />
  <img src={useBaseUrl("img/features/notifications/notification-unread.png")} alt="Notifications icon" />
</p>

### List of Notifications

The list of notifications is fully customizable, allowing you to tailor the notifications to the needs of your
application. Users can mark all notifications as read from the menu, making it easy to keep track of new notifications.
The status and list of notifications are updated using live GraphQL subscriptions over websocket communication, ensuring
that users always have the latest information.
