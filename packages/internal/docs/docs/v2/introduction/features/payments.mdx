SaaS Boilerplate provides a payments and subscriptions functionality out of the box based on the integration with
Stripe. This functionality is divided into two parts: **[payments](#payments)** and
**[subscription management](#subscription-management)**.

### Payments

The payments functionality allows users to define payment methods (including multiple cards) that are stored in the
Stripe merchant account. Users can edit and update their payment methods at any time.

</p>

The payment form allows users to make transactions with a defined amount of USD, using an already added payment method
or adding a new card for one time charge. Successful transactions are added to the transaction history list.

</p>

### Subscription management

The subscription management functionality allows users to select one of the three pre-defined plans in the Stripe admin
panel: Free, Monthly, and Yearly. The selected plan is automatically registered as an active subscription in the system
and can be used in the business logic of the application. The system supports changing and canceling subscriptions
based on the rules defined by the application administrator in Stripe.

Having Stripe payments integrated from the start of a SaaS project offers several advantages. First, it allows for a
seamless user experience, as users can easily subscribe to paid plans and make payments without leaving the application.
Second, it allows for better financial tracking and reporting, as all payment information is stored in the Stripe
merchant account. Finally, it provides a scalable payment solution that can grow with the application, as Stripe
supports a wide range of payment methods and currencies.

_Payments and subscriptions functionality is a critical component of any SaaS application. SaaS Boilerplate offers a
robust payments and subscriptions solution out of the box, integrated with Stripe. This functionality includes payment
method management, a payment form for transactions, active subscription management, and the ability to change and cancel
subscriptions._
