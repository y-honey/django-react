title: E2E tests
---

End-to-end (E2E) testing is a methodology that allows developers to test their applications from start to finish,
simulating real-world scenarios to ensure that the application is working as intended. E2E testing has become
increasingly important in SaaS projects, where reliability and scalability are essential. The SaaS Boilerplate includes
integrated E2E tests that make it easy to test the application and ensure that it is working as intended.

### Advantages of E2E Testing

There are several advantages to using E2E testing in SaaS projects. First and foremost, it allows tester to test the
application from start to finish, simulating real-world scenarios and ensuring that the application is working as
intended. E2E testing also allows to catch issues early in the development process, reducing the time and effort
required to fix bugs and issues.

### E2E Testing in the SaaS Boilerplate

The SaaS Boilerplate includes integrated E2E tests that make it easy to test the application. The E2E tests are
integrated with the AWS Codepipeline, allowing to manage when and if the tests are run by the infrastructure.

Testers can easily run regression tests, ensuring that any changes to the application do not introduce new bugs or
issues. This reduces the time and effort required to fix bugs and issues, allowing testers to focus on more complicated
features and creating even more automation.

The E2E tests in the SaaS Boilerplate are written in [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), a popular testing framework
that allows you to write tests in JavaScript.
