title: Admin panel
---

The SaaS Boilerplate provides an admin feature that allows developers to manage data and perform administrative tasks
using the [Django admin site](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/contrib/admin/). The admin feature is designed
to provide a quick, model-centric interface that allows developers to manage data and perform custom admin actions.

### Using the Django Admin Site

The SaaS Boilerplate uses the Django admin site to provide a user-friendly interface for managing data. The Django admin
site is a powerful tool that allows developers to manage data and perform administrative tasks, such as adding, editing,
and deleting records. The admin site is built on top of Django's models, which means that it can read metadata from
models to provide a quick, model-centric interface.

### Access to Custom Admin Actions

The SaaS Boilerplate admin panel provides access to custom admin actions that allow developers to perform specific tasks
related to their application. For example, itâ€™s possible to export user data using a custom admin action. The custom
admin action can be added to the admin site using the built-in admin action interface, which makes it easy to add custom
functionality to the admin site.
