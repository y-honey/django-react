SaaS Boilerplate comes packed with powerful development tools that can help developers build high-quality applications
faster and more efficiently. These tools are designed to be easy to use and provide developers with actionable insights
into how their applications are performing. In this article, we'll take a closer look at each of these tools and their
advantages.

### Version Matrix

The version matrix is an internal tool that displays a list of all environments that are configured, along with their
actual metadata, like the currently deployed version and deployment time. This tool can be a source of information for
the team about the currently deployed application state. It helps to keep track of the version history, and it's easy to
compare the different environments.

### Mailcatcher

[Mailcatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/) is a popular development tool used to capture all emails sent from the local
backend environment. It's a great way to test email functionality and ensure that everything is working as expected
before deploying to a cloud environment. With Mailcatcher, developers can view all emails sent from the application in
one place, making it easier to test and debug email functionality.

### Storybooks

[Storybooks](https://storybook.js.org/) is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. It
allows developers to work on individual components without having to navigate through the entire application. Storybooks
make it easier to build, test, and refine UI components, improving the overall quality of the application.

### Plop

[Plop](https://plopjs.com/) is a code generation tool that helps with creating repeatable code parts faster. It allows
developers to create templates for common code patterns and generate code with a single command. Plop automates the
repetitive parts of coding, freeing up time to focus on more complex tasks.

their applications. It is designed to capture errors, exceptions, and performance metrics in real-time and provide
developers with actionable insights into how their applications are performing. Sentry helps developers to identify
issues before they become bigger problems, ensuring the application runs smoothly.
