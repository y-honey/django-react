[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a query language for APIs that allows developers to define the structure of the data
they need, making it easier to fetch multiple resources with a single request. GraphQL has become increasingly popular
in recent years due to its flexibility and efficiency. The SaaS Boilerplate includes GraphQL API in all modules, making
it a powerful tool for building scalable and efficient applications.

### Benefits of GraphQL

There are several benefits to using GraphQL in your projects. First and foremost, it allows to fetch only the data that
is needed, reducing the amount of data transferred over the network. This reduces the response time and improves the
performance of the application. GraphQL also provides a flexible and intuitive way to query data, making it easier to
build complex applications. With GraphQL, developers can define the structure of the data, which makes it easier to
fetch multiple resources with a single request.

### GraphQL in the SaaS Boilerplate

The SaaS Boilerplate includes GraphQL API in all modules, making it easy to build scalable and efficient applications.
The SaaS Boilerplate provides automated scripts that take care of updating frontend code, ensuring that all types are
correct. This makes it easy to add and modify new queries and mutations based on the ready-to-use application code,
reducing the time and effort required to build your application.

The SaaS Boilerplate also supports real-time data updates using subscriptions. With subscriptions, developers can create
a live connection between the client and server, allowing for real-time communication and updates.
