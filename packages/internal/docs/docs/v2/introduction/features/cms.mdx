SaaS Boilerplate offers a powerful CMS functionality out of the box that is integrated with Contentful.

Using the CMS functionality in SaaS Boilerplate allows developers and administrators to easily manage content in the
application, without having to modify the code. This makes it easy to update content, such as terms and conditions or
pricing plans, without needing to redeploy the application.

#### Contentful

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) is a flexible and scalable content management system that allows developers
to create and manage content in a headless fashion. Contentful makes it easy to manage content across multiple channels
and platforms, including websites, mobile apps, and IoT devices.

### CMS Functionality in SaaS Boilerplate

SaaS Boilerplate offers two parts of the application that use content from the CMS.

Firstly, content for `Terms and Conditions` and `Privacy Policy` documents in the application are loaded from the CMS
instance. This functionality demonstrates how to manage and show mainly static text in the application.

</p>

Secondly, all items from the "Demo Contentful Items" application page are synced with Contentful. On the list, users can
see different items that the application admin can manage through the CMS. Each item has a "star" indicator that can be
clicked and saved as a "favorite" item. This example shows how to fill application content managed from CMS and link the
custom application logic with it.

#### Extending and using the CMS Functionality

The two implementations of the CMS functionality in SaaS Boilerplate are just examples of how to use the integration
with Contentful. The functionality is easy to extend and use in different places throughout the application.

Developers can use the CMS functionality to manage and deliver content in different parts of the application, such as
pricing plans, product descriptions, or blog posts. The flexibility of Contentful allows developers to create and manage
content in a headless fashion, making it easy to deliver content across multiple channels and platforms.
