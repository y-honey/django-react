SaaS Boilerplate offers an email system functionality out of the box, providing developers with a powerful tool to
engage users through email. This functionality covers everything from creating and sending email templates to scheduling
emails and sending test emails for debugging purposes.

### Lively email templates in React using Storybooks

The email system functionality allows developers to build lively templates in React using Storybooks, allowing them to
get creative with their email designs. Storybooks provide a live development environment for building UI components,
making it easier to develop and test email templates before they are sent.

### Standard email templates

The functionality includes a set of ready-to-send transactional emails, such as *new user verification*, *password
recovery*, *subscription renewals* making it easy for developers to get started.

### Creating new email templates

Creating new email templates is a breeze using the email template generator and developer-friendly API.

### Scheduling emails

The email system functionality also includes the ability to schedule emails at a given time, allowing developers to send
emails at the most optimal time for their users.

### Sending test emails

Sending test emails is made easy with the ability to send test emails directly from a Storybook to Mailcatcher service.
This allows developers to debug and test their email templates before they are sent to users.

### Internationalization Support

The email system functionality also includes internationalization support, allowing developers to create email templates
in multiple languages to better engage with their global users.
