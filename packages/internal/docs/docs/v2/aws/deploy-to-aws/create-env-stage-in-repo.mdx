# Step 1: Initialize an environment stage in code repository

SaaS Boilerplate provides the ability to deploy various versions of your application, such as QA, staging, or
production. You have the flexibility to determine their naming conventions and the number of environments required.
The only exception is the local environment, which is a specialized preconfigured environment utilized for running
SaaS Boilerplate on local machine.

All environments can either be deployed to a single AWS account or to separate ones, depending on your cloud governance
policies and preferences.

This article will guide you through all the necessary steps to deploy a new environment to AWS.

## Create a configuration file

You can use a simple dotenv file in root of the project that will describe your environment.
For example to create a QA env stage configuration run following command:

```bash
cp .env.stage-example .env.qa
```

## Learn more

Follow the [API reference of the `.env`](../../api-reference/env-files) files for the details of the contents of the
environment stage dotenv file.
