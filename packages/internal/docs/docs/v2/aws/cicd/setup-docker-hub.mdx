# Setup Docker Hub account

We need to setup dockerhub credentials in order receive access to their images base.
You can create new dockerhub account (there is a free tier) or get access to a existing one from the client.
Third option is to use guest account (empty credentials) but in that case there is a very limited number daily downloads which is shared with other AWS users which will cause builds to fail randomly (quite often).

To setup dockerhub credentials go to AWS web panel, access `Secrets manager` and select `GlobalBuildSecrets`, now find `Secret value` section and click `Retrieve secret value` and then `edit`.
This secret may initially be set to a placeholder value, which you can delete.

Secret's value have to be an object:

```shell
{
  "DOCKER_USERNAME": "example@email.com",
  "DOCKER_PASSWORD": "password123"
}
```
