Getting started with the SaaS Boilerplate by Apptension is easy and straightforward. To begin, you can either run a new project from scratch or run an existing project.

If you're starting a new project, follow the instructions in the "[Run new project](/v2/getting-started/run-project/run-new-project)" section. This will guide you through the process of setting up the boilerplate and starting a new SaaS project.

If you already have an existing project with the SaaS Boilerplate instance, you can run it locally by following the steps outlined in the "[Run existing project](/v2/getting-started/run-project/run-existing-project)" section.

No matter which option you choose, you'll be up and running with the SaaS Boilerplate in a matter of minutes!
