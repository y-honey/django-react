### Start the app

This section provides instructions for running the SaaS Boilerplate locally on your machine. It covers three main areas: starting the local dev web server, starting the backend services using docker-compose, and (optionally) launching a local documentation instance based on Docusaurus.

#### Start backend

Project includes a set of backend services that can be run using docker-compose:

```bash
nx run core:docker-compose:up
```

or a shorter version:

```bash
make up
```

This will run docker containers for all the backend services in the detached mode.

Backend is running on `http://localhost:5001`.

Admin Panel is running on `http://admin.localhost:5001`.

Workers trigger server is running on `http://localhost:3005`.

Mailcatcher is running on `http://localhost:1080`. Check the [dedicated doc](/v2/working-with-sb/dev-tools/sentry) before using.

#### Start webapp

To start the local development web server, you'll need to run a following command in your terminal:

```bash
nx start webapp
```

Web app is running on `http://localhost:3000`.

#### Start documentation

Finally, the SaaS Boilerplate comes with a local documentation instance based on Docusaurus. This provides easy access to the documentation while you're working on your SaaS product, so you can quickly find answers to any questions you may have.

```bash
nx start docs
```

Docs app is running on `http://localhost:3006`.
