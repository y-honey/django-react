## UserProfile model

In <ProjectName/>, the `UserProfile` model is designed to be customizable and extensible.
This means that you can easily add additional fields to the `UserProfile` model as needed.

To add additional fields to the `UserProfile` model, you can follow the same steps as you would to add a single field.
Simply modify the `UserProfile` class definition in `models.py` to include the new fields, create a database migration, and apply the migration.

For example, if you wanted to add a field for the user's phone number, you could add the following line to the `UserProfile` class definition:

```python title="packages/backend/apps/users/models.py" showLineNumbers
from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin
from django.db import models


class User(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
    # ...


class UserProfile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="profile")
    # ...
    # highlight-next-line
    phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=20, blank=True, default='')  # New field
```

Then, you need to create a new migration and apply it.

## Filling UserProfile field on signup

### Updating the UserManager

The `UserManager` is a class that is responsible for creating a user and related models.
It is part of the `users` app and is used to manage the creation and modification of user accounts.
To add a `phone_number` value on signup, you can simply add `phone_number` argument to the `create_user` method, and than pass it to `UserProfile.objects.create`.

```python title="packages/backend/apps/users/models.py" showLineNumbers
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import BaseUserManager, Group, AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin
from common.acl.helpers import CommonGroups


class UserManager(BaseUserManager):
    def create_user(self, email, password=None, phone_number=''):
        if not email:
            raise ValueError("Users must have an email address")

        user = self.model(
            email=self.normalize_email(email),
        )
        user.set_password(password)
        user_group = Group.objects.get(name=CommonGroups.User)
        user.save(using=self._db)

        user.groups.add(user_group)

        # highlight-next-line
        UserProfile.objects.create(user=user, phone_number=phone_number)

        return user

    # ...


class User(AbstractBaseUser, PermissionsMixin):
    # ...


class UserProfile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="profile")
    # ...
    phone_number = models.CharField(max_length=20, blank=True, default='')  # New field
```

:::note
Remember about adjusting the `create_superuser` method of `UserManager` accordingly if needed.

### Updating UserSignupSerializer

The signup process in the <ProjectName/> is conducted by the `SignUpMutation` class, which uses the `UserSignupSerializer`.

The `UserSignupSerializer` is responsible for handling the business logic of creating a new user account.
It validates the input data, creates a new user account using the `UserManager` class, and returns the serialized data for the new user.

To fill the `phone_number` field during the signup process, you need to add this field to the `UserSignupSerializer` class `Meta` fields and then inside the `create` method, pass the `validated_data["phone_number"]` to the `create_user` method of the `UserManager` class.

Inside the `Meta` class of the `UserSignupSerializer`, add the `phone_number` field to the `fields` attribute. For example:

```python title="packages/backend/apps/users/serializers.py" showLineNumbers
from django.contrib import auth as dj_auth
from rest_framework import serializers


class UserSignupSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
  # ...

  class Meta:
      model = dj_auth.get_user_model()
      fields = (
          "id",
          # ...
          "phone_number"
      )
```

Then, inside the `create` method of the `UserSignupSerializer`, pass the `validated_data["phone_number"]` to the `create_user` method of the `UserManager` class.

```python title="packages/backend/apps/users/serializers.py" showLineNumbers
from django.contrib import auth as dj_auth
from django.contrib.auth.models import update_last_login
from rest_framework import serializers
from rest_framework_simplejwt import  tokens as jwt_tokens
from rest_framework_simplejwt.settings import api_settings as jwt_api_settings

from . import  tokens,  notifications


class UserSignupSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
  # ...

  def create(self, validated_data):
      user = dj_auth.get_user_model().objects.create_user(
          email=validated_data["email"],
          password=validated_data["password"],
          # highlight-next-line
          phone_number=validated_data["phone_number"]
      )

      refresh = jwt_tokens.RefreshToken.for_user(user)

      if jwt_api_settings.UPDATE_LAST_LOGIN:
          update_last_login(None, user)

      notifications.AccountActivationEmail(
          user=user, data={'user_id': user.id.hashid, 'token': tokens.account_activation_token.make_token(user)}
      ).send()

      return {
        'id': user.id,
        'email': user.email,
        'access': str(refresh.access_token),
        'refresh': str(refresh),
        # highlight-next-line
        'phone_number': user.profile.phone_number
      }
```

## Update CurrentUserType

The current logged-in user can be fetched by `currentUser` query which uses `CurrentUserType` class (a subclass of the `DjangoObjectType` provided by the `graphene-django` library).

:::tip
More information on Queries and DjangoObjectTypes can be found at [Graphene-Django "Queries & ObjectTypes"](https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/queries/#queries-objecttypes)
:::

```python title="packages/backend/apps/users/schema.py" showLineNumbers
import graphene
from graphene_django import DjangoObjectType

from . import models
from .services.users import get_user_from_resolver


class CurrentUserType(DjangoObjectType):
    phone_number = graphene.String()

    class Meta:
        model = models.User
        fields = (
          "id",
          # ...
          "phone_number"
        )

    @staticmethod
    def resolve_phone_number(parent, info):
        return get_user_from_resolver(info).profile.phone_number
```

The `phone_number` field is defined as a `graphene.String()` field on the `CurrentUserType` class.
This field will be returned in the GraphQL query response alongside the default fields provided by the `DjangoObjectType`.

The `Meta` inner class of `CurrentUserType` specifies that the model to be used is the `User` model from the `models.py` file.
The `fields` attribute specifies which fields should be returned in the GraphQL response. It's required to add `phone_number` field there.

The `resolve_phone_number` method is a static method that returns the phone number for the currently authenticated user.
This method takes two arguments: `parent` and `info`.
The `parent` argument refers to the parent object in a GraphQL query, while the `info` argument contains information about the current GraphQL execution context.
This function is used to retrieve the current user's profile and return the `phone_number` field.

The `get_user_from_resolver` function is a utility function that retrieves the current authenticated user from the GraphQL execution context.

:::note
> This Parent Value Object (parent) is sometimes named obj, parent, or source in other GraphQL documentation. It can also be named after the value object being resolved (ex. root for a root Query or Mutation, and person for a Person value object). Sometimes this argument will be named self in Graphene code, but this can be misleading due to Implicit staticmethod while executing queries in Graphene.

## Updating the UserProfile

The `UpdateCurrentUserMutation` class uses the `serializers.UserProfileSerializer` to handle the business logic of updating the current user's profile information.
It defines the fields that can be updated and how they should be validated.
To make the `phone_number` available to update, you can simply put add it into `fields` property of the `Meta` class.

```python title="packages/backend/apps/users/serializers.py" showLineNumbers
from rest_framework import serializers
from . import models


class UserProfileSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    # ...

    class Meta:
        model = models.UserProfile
        fields = (
            # ...
            "phone_number"
        )
```
