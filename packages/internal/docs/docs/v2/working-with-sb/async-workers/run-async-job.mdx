import ProjectName from '../../shared/components/ProjectName.component';

In the <ProjectName/>, asynchronous jobs are represented as tasks.
These tasks are defined as classes that inherit from a `Task` class provided by the <ProjectName/>.
The `Task` class provides a framework for defining tasks that can be executed asynchronously.

When a task is executed, it is passed to an AWS Lambda function as an event.
The AWS Lambda function then processes the event and executes the task asynchronously.

#### Invoking tasks

Running asynchronous tasks from the backend is made easy with the `Task` class.
The `Task` class is a utility class that allows you to define and run asynchronous tasks in a clean and organized way.

```python showLineNumbers
import importlib
from django.conf import settings

module_name, package = settings.TASKS_BASE_HANDLER.rsplit(".", maxsplit=1)
Task = getattr(importlib.import_module(module_name), package)


class ExampleTask(Task):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="example_task", source='backend.example_task')
```

:::info
`Task` uses the `boto3` library to interact with the Amazon EventBridge service.
When a particular task is invoked, it generates an event entry that is sent to the EventBridge service using the `put_events` method of the `boto3` client.
[Learn more about Amazon EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-what-is.html).
:::

The `importlib` module provides tools for dynamically importing Python modules at runtime.
The code then uses the imported modules to dynamically import a task handler module specified in the Django project's settings.
The `TASKS_BASE_HANDLER` setting is a string that specifies the module and class name of the base task handler.
The `getattr()` function is used to get the `Task` class from the dynamically imported module.

The `ExampleTask` class is then defined as a subclass of `Task`.
The `__init__` method of `ExampleTask` is used to set up the task.
It sets up the basic properties of the task, such as its name and source.
The `name` and `source` parameters can be used to identify the task to run within the serverless application.

Make sure to check ["How to create a new workers module?"](./create-workers-module) to learn how to register and configure your task handlers.

Next, to invoke this task you can simply do:

```python showLineNumbers
data = {
    # ...
}
task = ExampleTask()
task.apply(data=data)
```

The `apply()` method is responsible for executing the task.
It takes the `data` parameter and performs the necessary actions to complete the task.
