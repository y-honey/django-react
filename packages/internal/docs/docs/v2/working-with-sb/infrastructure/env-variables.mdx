title: How to configure environment variables on AWS?
description: TODO >Description<
---

Every running application requires environment-specific runtime values to function properly. These values could include
secret keys for third-party services, boolean flags enabling features, and much more.

To manage these variables, the SaaS Boilerplate leverages AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store and a tool called
[`chamber`](https://github.com/segmentio/chamber). With these tools, managing environment variables is easy and secure.

:::caution

Before deploying your application's code, you must set all required environmental variables!

:::note

The steps below assume that you have properly configured the **AWS vault** tool for your environment. If you need help
with this, you can find instructions [here](/v2/working-with-sb/infrastructure/initial-setup#aws-vault-profile).

## Set env variables for the service

## Setting environment variables for a service

### Using the CLI tool

To set environment variables for a service using the CLI tool, first log in to your AWS vault with the correct `ENV_STAGE`:

```shell
make login ENV_STAGE=<STAGE_NAME>
```

You can then set the environment variables for the service (such as `backend`) in JSON format using the following `make` rule:

```shell
make -C packages/<SERVICE_NAME> secrets
```

This will download a JSON secrets file, open it in Vim, and re-upload it when you save the file.

### Manually using the AWS console

Alternatively, you can set your environment variables manually by going to the
[AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) and adding or editing the parameters in the
`Systems Manager > Parameter Store` section.

Note that the **Name** of every parameter should follow this naming convention:
```
/env-<PROJECT_NAME>-<STAGE_NAME>-<SERVICE_NAME>/<ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_NAME>
```
in order to be correctly loaded into
a container environment using `chamber`.
