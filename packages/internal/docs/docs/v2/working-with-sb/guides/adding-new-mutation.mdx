## Django model based mutation

Let's imagine you have a `store` module and you want to include a new database model that allows your users to create
new products.

:::info

If you're also interested in front-end part of this guide check out [Form with mutation](./form-with-mutation) guide.

:::

### Create Django model

You may already have your own model, but the examples in this guide are built upon the following Django model:

```python title="packages/backend/apps/store/models.py"
import hashid_field
from django.db import models


class Product(models.Model):
    id = hashid_field.HashidAutoField(primary_key=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
```

### Create Django Rest Framework serializer

In Saas Boilerplate, GraphQL mutations use DRF Serializers to validate data and run business logic.

:::warning

Even if you use DRF `ModelSerializer`, all fields are treated as write-only. This is because mutations return GraphQL
type objects, which are defined independently from serializers.

:::

```python title="packages/backend/apps/store/serializers.py"
from hashid_field import rest as hidrest
from rest_framework import serializers


class ProductSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    id = hidrest.HashidSerializerCharField(source_field="store.Product.id", read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = models.Product
        fields = ('id', 'name',)
```

This is essentially a regular DRF serializer. Although this example only demonstrates the "create" aspect of CRUD, you can perform all side effects in either the `update` or `create` method.

Moreover, you can connect this serializer to more than one mutation, similar to how you would do it with DRF views.

### Define GraphQL type and connection

You can use Graphene Django to automatically generate GraphQL schema for Django models. Your future mutation will
reference those types to build both input and output schema.

```python title="packages/backend/apps/store/schema.py"
from graphene import relay
from graphene_django import DjangoObjectType

from . import models

class ProductType(DjangoObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = models.Product
        interfaces = (relay.Node,)
        fields = "__all__"


class ProductConnection(graphene.Connection):
    class Meta:
        node = ProductType
```

- [DjangoObjectType](https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/queries/) – automatically transforms a
Django Model into a ObjectType for you
- [Connection](https://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/relay/connection/) – A connection is a vitaminized version of
a List that provides ways of slicing and paginating through it.

### Create mutation object

Next, you need to create a mutation object that references the previously created serializer class. Please ensure that
you also define an `edge_class` in `Meta`, or else your schema will not include the `productEdge` field. This field
could be useful to your frontend, as it can be used to easily push newly created data into an existing collection.

```python title="packages/backend/apps/store/schema.py"
from common.graphql import mutations
from . import models, serializers

class CreateProductMutation(mutations.CreateModelMutation):
    class Meta:
        serializer_class = serializers.ProductSerializer
        edge_class = ProductConnection.Edge
```

- [CreateModelMutation](../../api-reference/backend/graphql-mutations#createmodelmutation) – a base class that
makes django model based mutations that create instances much simpler

:::tip

SaaS Boilerplate also implements:
- [UpdateModelMutation](../../api-reference/backend/graphql-mutations#updatemodelmutation),
- [DeleteModelMutation](../../api-reference/backend/graphql-mutations#deletemodelmutation)
- and a more generic [SerializerMutation](../../api-reference/backend/graphql-mutations#serializermutation).

:::

### Create mutation field in schema

Last but not least we need to connect our mutation to the GraphQL schema!

```python title="packages/backend/apps/store/schema.py"
class Mutation(graphene.ObjectType):
    create_product = CreateProductMutation.Field()
```

It is possible that the referenced file already contains a `Mutation` object. If that is the case, you can add your mutation as another field beside the existing ones.

However, if it does not exist yet, it is important to add it to the root of the schema. Think of this similarly to
`urls.py` used by Django apps. It is located in `config` python package.

```python title="packages/backend/config/schema.py"
from apps.store import schema as store_schema

# ...

schema = graphene.Schema(
    query=graphql_query([
        # ...
        store_schema.Query,
    ]),
    mutation=graphql_mutation(
        [
            # ...
            store_schema.Mutation,
        ]
    ),
)

```
