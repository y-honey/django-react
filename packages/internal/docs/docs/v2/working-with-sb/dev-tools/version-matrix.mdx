## Configuration

You can configure version matrix in `.env.tools` file in the root of your project. You can find the details in
[`.env.tools` API Reference](../../api-reference/env-files#envtools).


## Deployment

Deployment of the version matrix service contains two steps. First, you need to run build command:
```shell
nx run status-dashboard:build
```

After successful build you can run AWS deployment script:

```shell
nx run status-dashboard:deploy
```

:::caution

This command should be called only within `make login ENV_STAGE=<STAGE_NAME>` command and assumes that
[AWS vault](../../working-with-sb/infrastructure/initial-setup#aws-vault-profile) is configured.

## Updating version on CI pipeline

Application environment version and individual services versions are updated automatically on the CI/CD pipeline using
`nx run tools:upload-version` and `nx run tools:upload-service-version` commands.

:::info

Find more about `nx run tools:upload-version` and `nx run tools:upload-service-version` commands in the
[`tools` package API Reference](../../api-reference/tools/commands).
