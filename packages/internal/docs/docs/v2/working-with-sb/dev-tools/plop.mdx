The `plop` tool is a popular and powerful tool for generating project files and code snippets. It allows you to create
custom generators that will automate repetitive tasks and improve your development workflow. In this project, we have
configured several generators that you can use to quickly create common project elements.

#### Usage

To run `plop` tool use the following command from `packages/webapp` directory:

```bash
