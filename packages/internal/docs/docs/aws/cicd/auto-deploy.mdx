title: Configure Automatic Deployments

import useBaseUrl from '@docusaurus/useBaseUrl';

Each deployed environment comes with a preconfigured CI/CD implemented with AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild,
and AWS CodePipeline. The general idea of the deployment is for the user to push the code to a `master` branch of the
CodeCommit repository created by the Ci CDK Stack.

## Automatically synchronize external repository

### Get authenticated repository URL

AWS Boilerplate generates a user for you that has minimal permissions required for pushing code to the CodeCommit
repository. In order to implement a synchronization logic we need to get a repository URL and credentials of the user.
You can create both using a following command:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="Mac OS" default>
    <CodeBlock>
      saas aws est-env qa
      <br />
      saas ci create-credentials | pbcopy
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    <CodeBlock>
      saas aws est-env qa
      <br />
      saas ci create-credentials | xclip -sel clip
    </CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The result will be copied to your clipboard. Make sure you save it in some secure place. You can only create two such
URLs so if something goes wrong just open `external-ci` user's page in AWS IAM's web panel and delete appropriate key.

### Get authentication credentials for ECR repository

All CI pipeline builds are running within a docker image; some services, such as web app, utilise a base image that
contain preinstalled packages to speed up the whole process. Such base images automatically update on every
push to a `master` branch, so they are up to date with your code, and you don't have to really do anything besides
providing access to pull them!

1. Open `IAM` service in web console.

2. Find the `external-ci` user.

3. Navigate to `Security Credentials` tab.

4. Press `Create access key`.

5. Copy the key id and secret.

### Configure Github

1. Open `Settings` page of your repository.

2. Go to `Secrets` subpage.

3. Create following secrets:

   - `CODE_COMMIT_REPO` – [authenticated repository URL](#get-authenticated-repository-url)

   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` – [external-ci](#get-authentication-credentials-for-ecr-repository) user access key id

   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` – [external-ci](#get-authentication-credentials-for-ecr-repository) user access key secret

   - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` – set to a region to which your system is deployed

4. Test by pushing some code to your Github repository. After couple of seconds the code should be synchronized in CodeCommit.

### Configure Bitbucket

1. Open `Repository Settings` page of your repository.

2. Go to `Pipeline / Settings` sub-page.

3. Enable Bitbucket Pipelines.

4. Go to `Pipeline / Repository variables` sub-page.

5. Create following variables:

   - `CODE_COMMIT_REPO` – set value to
     [authenticated repository URL](#get-authenticated-repository-url)

   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` – `external-ci` user access key id

   - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` – `external-ci` user access key secret

   - `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` – set to a region to which your system is deployed

6. Test by pushing some code to your BitBucket repository. After couple of seconds the code should be synchronized in CodeCommit.

## Trigger deployment automatically

If you want a branch to be deployed automatically for every pushed commit the only thing you need to do is to name this branch
in your environment configuration file using `SB_DEPLOY_BRANCHES` environment variable. Check out the
[environment docs](/api-reference/env-files#envenv-id) for more details.
