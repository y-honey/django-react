## Adjust `.env.shared` files

Root and almost all packages allow configuration through environmental variables. For local machine those
need to be present in so called `.env` files. Those are of course ignored in GIT to avoid secret values being committed
and shared with everyone. We prepared a set of defaults in form or `.env.shared` files located in the same directories
that will be enough to run the project locally but a few need to be adjusted before you start the project for the first time.

:::caution

Never store any secret values in those files!

:::

##### `.env.shared` (in project root)

| Name         | Example | Description                                                                        |
| ------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PROJECT_NAME | myapp   | The name of your project (best if 3-5 characters to avoid AWS names being to long) |

##### `./packages/backend/.env.shared`

| Name                   | Example                           | Description                                                                                          |
