[Mailcatcher](https://mailcatcher.me/) is a popular development tool used to capture all emails sent from the local
backend environment. It's a great way to test email functionality and ensure that everything is working as expected
before deploying to production.

## Usage

The <ProjectName/> includes Mailcatcher as part of its development tools, so it will start automatically along with
all backend services. To access Mailcatcher, simply go to [`localhost:1080`](http://localhost:1080) in your web browser.
This will take you to the Mailcatcher web interface, where you can view all emails sent from your local environment.
