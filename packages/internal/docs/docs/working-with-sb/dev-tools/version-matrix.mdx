## Configuration

You can configure version matrix via AWS SSM Parameter Store. You can find the details in
[\[Optional\] Set tools env variables](../../aws/deploy-to-aws/create-env-stage-in-repo#optional-set-tools-env-variables).


## Deployment

Deployment of the version matrix service contains two steps. First, you need to run build command:
```shell
pnpm nx run status-dashboard:build
```

After successful build you can run AWS deployment script:

```shell
pnpm nx run status-dashboard:deploy
```

:::caution

This command should be called only after `saas aws set-env [STAGE_NAME]` command.
