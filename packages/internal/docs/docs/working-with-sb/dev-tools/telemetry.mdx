# SaaS Boilerplate CLI Telemetry
The <ProjectName /> CLI is designed to offer an efficient and user-friendly experience. To help us improve the service
for everyone, the CLI collects anonymous feature usage information, errors encountered, and other relevant performance
metrics.

## Why Do We Collect Telemetry Data?
The primary goal of collecting telemetry data is to gain insights into how the CLI is used, understand any issues users
might be facing, and improve the overall experience. This allows us to prioritize new features, identify bugs, and make
the CLI more reliable and efficient for everyone.

## What Data Is Collected?
The <ProjectName /> CLI collects the following data:

- Errors
- Flags and arguments passed to the CLI commands
- Anonymous system information, such as the operating system, version, and type
- Feature usage statistics

:::caution

Please note that we do not collect personally identifiable information, sensitive data, or any metadata about your
source code.

:::

## How Is the Data Collected and Processed?
Telemetry data is collected automatically when you use the CLI. This data is then processed and aggregated for
analytical purposes. We take care to anonymize all data so that it cannot be traced back to individual users.

## How Can I Inspect Collected Data?
You can inspect the data being collected by setting the `SB_TELEMETRY_DEBUG` environment variable to `1`.

Example:

```shell
SB_TELEMETRY_DEBUG=1 pnpm saas [some-command]
```

When this environment variable is set, the CLI will display the telemetry data collected for that session.

## Can I Opt-Out?
Yes, you can opt-out of telemetry data collection. To do so, set the `SB_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` environment variable to `1`.

Example:

```shell
SB_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 pnpm saas [some-command]
```

By setting this environment variable, the CLI will no longer collect any telemetry data.

## Data Sharing and Transparency
The telemetry data is anonymous and not traceable back to individuals. It is used solely for the purpose of improving
the CLI experience. We are committed to transparency and may, in the future, share aggregate data insights with the
community through public dashboards or similar means.

## Questions or Concerns?
We take your privacy seriously. If you have any questions or concerns about telemetry data collection, please feel free
to contact our support team.

Thank you for helping us make <ProjectName /> a better tool for everyone!
