description: Update TypeScript types based on GraphQL schema
---


One of the advantages of using GraphQL is the ability to generate TypeScript types from the GraphQL schema. This ensures
that the types used in the client code match those defined in the schema, which helps avoid errors and makes it easier to refactor the codebase.

Apollo Client documentation provides detailed information on how to
[use TypeScript with Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/development-testing/static-typing).

After making changes to the schema on the back-end, the types in the client application need to be updated accordingly.
In this article, we will describe the steps that need to be taken to update types based on the GraphQL schema in the
webapp application.

## Updating GraphQL TypeScript types instructions

To update types in the webapp application code, two steps need to be taken:

1. **Download schemas**

    To download the GraphQL schemas, run the command:
    ```bash
    pnpm nx run webapp:graphql:download-schema
    ```
    This command will introspect
    and save both schemas (main back-end API and Contentful API) to files located at
    ```
    packages/webapp-libs/webapp-api-client/graphql/schema/api.graphql
    packages/webapp-libs/webapp-contentful/graphql/schema/contentful.graphql
    ```

    Then you can generate types based on the downloaded files.

2. **Generate types**

    To generate the types based on the downloaded GraphQL schemas, run the following command:
    ```bash
    pnpm nx run webapp:graphql:generate-types
    ```
    This command uses the [`graphql-codegen`](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen) tool and a special configuration
    defined in `packages/webapp-libs/webapp-api-client/graphql/codegen.ts`.
    This configuration looks for `graphql/codegen.ts` files in the `webapp-libs` directory and merges them into a single
    configuration. Based on this configuration, it generates ready to use TypeScript types in
    `packages/webapp-libs/webapp-api-client/src/graphql/__generated`.

### Example Usage of the Generated Types

Once the types have been generated, they can be used in the webapp code. For example, suppose you woulid like to have a
query that fetches data from the API:

```typescript title=posts.graphql.ts showLineNumbers
import { gql } from '@sb/webapp-api-client/graphql';

export const getPostsQuery = gql(/* GraphQL */`
  query getPostsQuery() {
    posts {
      id
      title
    }
  }
`);
```

```typescript title=posts.component.tsx showLineNumbers
import { useQuery } from '@apollo/client';
import { getPostsQuery } from './posts.graphql';

function Posts() {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(getPostsQuery);

  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;

  return (
    <ul>
      {data?.posts.map(post => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

In the example above `data` returned from `useQuery` has correct types.
