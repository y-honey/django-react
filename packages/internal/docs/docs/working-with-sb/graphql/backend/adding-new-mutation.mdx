## Django model based mutation

Let's imagine you have a `store` module, and you want to include a new database model that allows your users to create, update and delete products.

:::info

If you're also interested in front-end part of this guide check out [Form with mutation](../web-app/form-with-mutation) guide.

:::

### Create Django model

You may already have your own model, but the examples in this guide are built upon the following Django model:

```python title="packages/backend/apps/store/models.py" showLineNumbers
import hashid_field
from django.db import models


class Product(models.Model):
    id = hashid_field.HashidAutoField(primary_key=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
```

### Create Django Rest Framework serializer

In <ProjectName/>, GraphQL mutations use DRF Serializers to validate data and run business logic.

:::warning

Even if you use DRF `ModelSerializer`, all fields are treated as write-only. This is because mutations return GraphQL
type objects, which are defined independently from serializers.

:::

```python title="packages/backend/apps/store/serializers.py" showLineNumbers
from hashid_field import rest as hidrest
from rest_framework import serializers


class ProductSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    id = hidrest.HashidSerializerCharField(source_field="store.Product.id", read_only=True)

    class Meta:
        model = models.Product
        fields = ('id', 'name',)
```

This is essentially a regular DRF serializer. You can perform all side effects in either the `update` or `create` method.

Moreover, you can connect this serializer to more than one mutation, similar to how you would do it with DRF views.

### Define GraphQL type and connection

You can use Graphene Django to automatically generate GraphQL schema for Django models. Your future mutation will
reference those types to build both input and output schema.

```python title="packages/backend/apps/store/schema.py" showLineNumbers
from graphene import relay
from graphene_django import DjangoObjectType

from . import models

class ProductType(DjangoObjectType):
    class Meta:
        model = models.Product
        interfaces = (relay.Node,)
        fields = "__all__"


class ProductConnection(graphene.Connection):
    class Meta:
        node = ProductType
```

- [DjangoObjectType](https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/queries/) – automatically transforms a
Django Model into a ObjectType for you
- [Connection](https://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/relay/connection/) – A connection is a vitaminized version of
a List that provides ways of slicing and paginating through it.

### Define mutations

#### CreateModelMutation

The `CreateModelMutation` class provides a generic implementation of a mutation that creates a new object of the specified model type.
It handles the creation of the object and validation of the input data, and returns the newly created object as part of the mutation response.
Please ensure that you also define an `edge_class` in `Meta`, or else your schema will not include the `productEdge` field.
This field could be useful to your frontend, as it can be used to easily push newly created data into an existing collection.

```python title="packages/backend/apps/store/schema.py" showLineNumbers
from common.graphql import mutations
from . import models, serializers


class CreateProductMutation(mutations.CreateModelMutation):
    class Meta:
        serializer_class = serializers.ProductSerializer
        edge_class = ProductConnection.Edge
```

#### UpdateModelMutation

The `UpdateModelMutation` class provides a generic implementation of a mutation that updates an object of the specified model type.
It handles the update of the object and validation of the input data, and returns the updated object as part of the mutation response.
`Meta` class fields are the same as above.

```python title="packages/backend/apps/store/schema.py" showLineNumbers
from common.graphql import mutations
from . import models, serializers


class CreateProductMutation(mutations.CreateModelMutation):
    class Meta:
        serializer_class = serializers.ProductSerializer
        edge_class = ProductConnection.Edge


class UpdateProductMutation(mutations.UpdateModelMutation):
    class Meta:
        serializer_class = serializers.ProductSerializer
        edge_class = ProductConnection.Edge
```

#### DeleteModelMutation

The `DeleteModelMutation` class is a subclass of `ClientIDMutation`.
It serves as a blueprint for mutations that delete objects from the database.

The `Meta` class attribute is used to specify the model that this mutation will operate on. In this case, it is set to `models.Product`.

To delete the object, developers can simply pass the `id` of the `Product` object they wish to delete as a parameter to the mutation.
The mutation will delete the object from the database and return a payload containing the ID of the deleted object.

```python title="packages/backend/apps/store/schema.py" showLineNumbers
from common.graphql import mutations
from . import models, serializers


class CreateProductMutation(mutations.CreateModelMutation):
    class Meta:
        serializer_class = serializers.ProductSerializer
        edge_class = ProductConnection.Edge


class UpdateProductMutation(mutations.UpdateModelMutation):
    class Meta:
        serializer_class = serializers.ProductSerializer
        edge_class = ProductConnection.Edge


class DeleteProductMutation(mutations.DeleteModelMutation):
    class Meta:
        model = models.Product
```

:::tip

See the API Reference for:
- [CreateModelMutation](../../../api-reference/backend/generated/common/graphql/mutations#createmodelmutation)
- [UpdateModelMutation](../../../api-reference/backend/generated/common/graphql/mutations#updatemodelmutation),
- [DeleteModelMutation](../../../api-reference/backend/generated/common/graphql/mutations#deletemodelmutation)
- and a more generic [SerializerMutation](../../../api-reference/backend/generated/common/graphql/mutations#serializermutation).

### Create mutation fields in schema

Last but not least we need to connect our mutations to the GraphQL schema!

```python title="packages/backend/apps/store/schema.py" showLineNumbers
import graphene
from common.graphql import mutations
from . import models, serializers


class CreateProductMutation(mutations.CreateModelMutation):
    class Meta:
        serializer_class = serializers.ProductSerializer
        edge_class = ProductConnection.Edge


class UpdateProductMutation(mutations.UpdateModelMutation):
    class Meta:
        serializer_class = serializers.ProductSerializer
        edge_class = ProductConnection.Edge


class DeleteProductMutation(mutations.DeleteModelMutation):
    class Meta:
        model = models.Product


class Mutation(graphene.ObjectType):
    create_product = CreateProductMutation.Field()
    update_product = UpdateProductMutation.Field()
    delete_product = DeleteProductMutation.Field()
```

It is possible that the referenced file already contains a `Mutation` object. If that is the case, you can add your mutation as another field beside the existing ones.

However, if it does not exist yet, it is important to add it to the root of the schema. Think of this similarly to
`urls.py` used by Django apps. It is located in `config` python package.

```python title="packages/backend/config/schema.py" showLineNumbers
from apps.store import schema as store_schema

# ...

schema = graphene.Schema(
    query=graphql_query([
        # ...
        store_schema.Query,
    ]),
    mutation=graphql_mutation(
        [
            # ...
            store_schema.Mutation,
        ]
    ),
)

```
