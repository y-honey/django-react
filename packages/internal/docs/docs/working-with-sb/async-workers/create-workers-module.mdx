import ProjectName from '../../shared/components/ProjectName.component';

In the context of the <ProjectName/>, asynchronous jobs are handled by AWS Lambda functions, which are managed by the Serverless Framework.
The Serverless Framework is an open-source framework for building applications that use serverless compute services such as AWS Lambda.
The framework provides a set of tools and abstractions that simplify the process of deploying and managing serverless applications.

Lambda functions can be triggered by events and can run code in response to those events.
The result of the task execution is returned by the AWS Lambda function as a response to the event.
This allows the SaaS application to handle asynchronous jobs without the need for dedicated servers or infrastructure.

## Defining handlers

Let's define an `example_task_handler()` AWS lambda handler function to log the incoming event:

```python title="packages/workers/example/handlers.py" showLineNumbers
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)


def example_task_handler(event, context):
    logger.info(event)
```

:::tip
You can check more examples in ["Lambda function handler in Python"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-handler.html)
:::

The `example_task_handler()` function is a handler function for an AWS Lambda.
The `event` parameter is a dictionary that contains information about the event that triggered the Lambda function.


## Registering handlers

To use the defined AWS Lambda function handler in the <ProjectName/>, it needs to be added to the `serverless.yml` file.

The `serverless.yml` file is a configuration file used by the Serverless Framework to deploy and manage serverless applications.

To add the AWS Lambda function handler to the `serverless.yml` file, you need to define a function in the `functions` section of the file. The `functions` section is where you define the AWS Lambda functions that make up your application.

For the above example, you would add the following code to the `serverless.yml` file:

```yaml title="packages/workers/serverless.yml"
functions:
  ExampleTaskHandler:
    handler: example.handlers.example_task_handler
    environment: ${self:custom.conf.ExampleTaskHandler.environment}
    events:
      - eventBridge:
          eventBus: "event-bus-arn"
          pattern:
            source:
              - backend.example_task
```

Here is a breakdown of what each of the properties means:

- `handler`: This property specifies the path to the handler function for this Lambda function.
In this case, it is `example.handlers.example_task_handler`.
This means that when the `ExampleTaskHandler` function is triggered, it will execute the code in the `example_task_handler` file.

- `environment`: This property specifies the environment variables to be used by the `ExampleTaskHandler` function.
In this case, it references the `self:custom.conf.ExampleTaskHandler.environment` variable, which will be defined in the next section of this guide.

- `events`: This property specifies the events that trigger this Lambda function.
In this case, it is an EventBridge event. The `eventBus` property specifies the Amazon EventBridge event bus that the function is listening to, and the `pattern` property specifies the event pattern to match against incoming events.
In this case, the function will be triggered by events with a `source` of `backend.example_task`.

## Configuration

It's possible to add custom configuration to AWS Lambda function handler.
In this example, let's add a custom environment variable to be accessible from inside the handler function.

```yaml title="packages/workers/serverless.yml"
custom:
  ssmService: env-${env:PROJECT_NAME}-${self:provider.stage}-workers
  conf: ${file(./${self:custom.confFile.${self:provider.stage}})}
  confFile:
    local: workers.conf.local.yml
    dev: workers.conf.yml
    qa: workers.conf.yml
    prod: workers.conf.yml
```

The `ssmService` field specifies the name of the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) parameter that contains the environment variables for the Lambda functions.
The SSM parameter is named based on the project name, deployment stage, and the word "workers".

For example, if the project name is "saas-boilerplate", and the deployment stage is `dev`, the SSM parameter name would be `env-saas-boilerplate-dev-workers`.
The use of SSM parameters allows for the secure storage and retrieval of environment variables for the Lambda functions.

:::

The `conf` field specifies the path to the configuration file that contains the settings for the Lambda functions.
The value of the `conf` field is defined using the Serverless Framework's `${file()}` syntax, which allows for the use of a file as a variable.

The `${self:custom.confFile.${self:provider.stage}}` syntax is used to specify the name of the configuration file based on the current deployment stage.
The `provider.stage` variable is used to determine the current deployment stage, and the `confFile` object is used to map the deployment stage to the appropriate configuration file.

For example, if the deployment stage is `prod`, the `conf` variable will be set to the contents of the `workers.conf.yml` file.
If the deployment stage is `local`, the `conf` variable will be set to the contents of the `workers.conf.local.yml` file.

Let's pass `HASHID_SALT` parameter from AWS SSM to our `ExampleTaskHandler`:

```yaml title="packages/workers/workers.conf.yml"
ExampleTaskHandler:
  environment:
    HASHID_SALT: ${ssm:/${self:custom.ssmService}/HASHID_SALT}
```

`${ssm:/${self:custom.ssmService}/HASHID_SALT}` is an AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store reference that retrieves the value of `HASHID_SALT` from the Parameter Store.
The `self:custom.ssmService` refers to the name of the SSM service that is defined in the `serverless.yml` file.
