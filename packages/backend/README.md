## Make rules

### `make install`

Runs installation of all required project dependencies.

### `make install-deploy`

This rule will be used by CodeBuild to install dependencies required to deploy previously built artifact. This rule
should most likely stay unchanged unless you know what you're doing!

### `make test`

Runs tests and linters inside docker container.

### `make build`

Builds docker images used by the backend and pushes them to AWS ECR repository. Make sure you're logged into the AWS
using `make aws-vault` command.

### `make deploy`

This rule deploys admin-panel, api, and migrations stacks.

One option to configure the python interpreter in pycharm is to add interpreter with docker/docker-compose option.
The advantage of this solution is independence from using python package manager.
