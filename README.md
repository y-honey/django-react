This project uses docusaurus for documentation purposes.

## Hosted documentation
Until you will modify this project, you can use documentation from the source SaaS Boilerplate project which is available [here](https://docs.qa.saas.apptoku.com/)
⚠️ This may be outdated, prefer the **Local documentation** as documented in then next section.

## Local documentation
In order to run your local documentation server execute following commands:
```sh
cd services/docs
yarn start
```
and go to `localhost:3001`.

### All changes, new features and project related technical information should be documented by being added to the `docs` service!!
