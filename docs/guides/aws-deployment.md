# Deploy the app to AWS

## Switch to aws-vault context
Always make sure you are in a proper aws-vault context when you run commands that use AWS CLI.
We created a `make` rule that simplifies this process:

```sh
make aws-vault
```

> Check out the [documentation](/docs/aws-vault.md) on how to set up aws-vault profile if you haven't done so already.

## Setup the infrastructure
Before you create any real AWS resources you need to bootstrap CDK first. You can do it by running the following command:

```shell
make setup-infra
```

##  Deploy Global Infrastructure to AWS
Next up is the [global infrastructure](/docs/infrastructure-components.md#global-infrastructure) CDK stack to create 
the foundations of your system. Resources created in this step will be used by all environments that you'll create in the 
future.

```shell
make deploy-global-infra
```

## Setup a new environment
AWS boilerplate allows you to deploy multiple versions of your application. Those, for example, could be `qa`, `staging`
, `production` or whatever else you desire. You decide how to call them and how many you would like to have.

> For more detailed version of this step check [new environment docs](/docs/app-environment)

```sh
make create-env
```

Let's say you created an environment named `dev`. Now you can switch to its aws-vault session:
```sh
make aws-vault ENV_STAGE=dev
```

Deploy environment's infrastructure:
```sh
make deploy-env-infra 
```

Define necessary environmental variables in SSM:
```sh
make -C services/backend secrets
```

(Optional) Deploy app's code:
```sh
make build
make deploy-stage-app
```

## Connect your repository to CI/CD
