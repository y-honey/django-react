title: Handling failed payments

Failed payments usually lead to a downgrade of the active plan to a free
plan.

## Failed payment on active subscription

Transition to a free plan does not always happen immediately. Sometimes
the customer's card might have only expired or the funds have not been
transferred to a specific account. You want to give them a chance to fix
this issue before disabling their access to paid services. Stripe provides
a very convenient way to handle this situation called [retry rules](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/automatic).


You can see expected configuration in the following image:

This configuration gives the customer 3 weeks to fix the problem, while
retrying the payment four times. If all four attempts fail the subscription
is cancelled. In backend code we defined a webhook handler that creates a new
subscription with a free plan after a subscription is cancelled to ensure
that every customer has at least one valid subscription instance.

## Failed first payment after free trial

If this has been a first payment attempt, just after leaving a free trial period,
we downgrade to a free plan immediately.
