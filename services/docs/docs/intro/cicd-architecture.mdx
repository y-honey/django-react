## Continuous integration / Continuous Deployment

Each deployed environment comes with a preconfigured CI/CD implemented with AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeBuild,
and AWS CodePipeline. The general idea of deployment is for the user to push code to a `master` branch of the CodeCommit
repository created by the Ci CDK Stack.
