title: Getting started with SaaS Boilerplate
slug: /
---

The primary objective of this boilerplate is to give you a production ready code that reduces the amount of time you
would normally have to spend on system infrastructure's configuration. It contains a number of services that a typical
web application has (frontend, backend api, admin panel, workers) as well as their continuous deployment. Using this
boilerplate you can deploy multiple environments, each representing a different stage in your pipeline.

We don't create any new CLIs or APIs that you need to learn. We use existing solutions,
which you can extend or change however you like:

- Make
- CDK (TypeScript)
- Serverless Framework
- Docker

## Prerequisites

- Install latest [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#macos) (with NPM >= 6)
- Install Python 3.8

> We recommend installing Python using [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)

- Install [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv#installation)
- Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) version 2
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker)

## Installation

We recommend cloning this repository instead of downloading the ZIP. This way you'll be able to
merge latest changes without too much hassle by resolving conflicts using your favourite tools.

To setup the project and install local dependencies run following command:

```sh
sh ./setup.sh
```

## Running locally

### Create .env files

Files with environmental variables are ignored in GIT to avoid secret values being commited and shared
with everyone. To make the app work as expected you need to initialize following `.env` files from `.env.example`
files located in the same directories:

- `services/webapp/.env` – variables loaded by webpack when you run the local dev server

- `services/backend/.env` – variables loaded by docker-compose when you run the backend server locally

- `services/workers/.env` – variables loaded by docker-compose when you invoke worker functions locally

### Run backend services:

```sh
make up
```

Backend is running on `http://localhost:5000`.

Admin Panel is running on `http://admin.localhost:5000`.

Workers trigger server is running on `http://localhost:3005`.

### Run webapp service:

```sh
cd services/webapp
yarn
yarn start
```
