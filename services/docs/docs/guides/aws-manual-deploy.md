title: Manual build & deploy to AWS
---
## Deploy application's code

This step is optional because it usually should be run through CI/CD pipeline. We didn't want to limit you so we also
prepared a way to deploy the app fully from your local machine. There are two steps â€“ building artifacts and deploying.


:::caution Dev Tools Needed

In order to execute manual deploy helper tools need to be deployed before. 

More info can be found [here](/features/dev-tools/global-tools)
